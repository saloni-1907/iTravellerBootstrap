          Chiang Mai succeeded Chiang Rai as the capital of Lan Na. Pha Yu
          enlarged and fortified the city, and built Wat Phra Singh in honor of
          his father Kham Fu.[2]:226–227 The ruler was known as the chao. The
          city was surrounded by a moat and a defensive wall since nearby
          Taungoo Dynasty of the Bamar people was a constant threat, as were the
          armies of the Mongol Empire, which decades earlier had conquered most
          of Yunnan, China, and in 1292 overran the bordering Dai kingdom of
          Chiang Hung. With the decline of Lan Na, the city lost importance and
          was occupied by the Taungoo in 1556.[9][failed verification] Chiang
          Mai formally became part of the Thonburi Kingdom in 1774 by an
          agreement with Chao Kavila, after the Thonburi king Taksin helped
          drive out the Taungoo Bamar. Subsequent Taungoo counterattack led to
          Chiang Mai's abandonment between 1776 and 1791.[10] Lampang then
          served as the capital of what remained of Lan Na. Chiang Mai then
          slowly grew in cultural, trading, and economic importance to its
          current status as the unofficial capital of Northern Thailand. Chiang
          Mai has improved its government and raised its status as a "province"
          since 1933 until the present. East gate (Tha Phae Gate) of the city
          wall The modern municipality dates to a sanitary district
          (sukhaphiban) that was created in 1915. It was upgraded to a city
          municipality (thesaban nakhon) on 29 March 1935.[11] First covering
          just 17.5 km2 (7 sq mi), the city was enlarged to 40.2 km2 (16 sq mi)
          on 5 April 1983.[12] In May 2006 Chiang Mai was the site of the Chiang
          Mai Initiative, concluded between the Association of Southeast Asian
          Nations and the "ASEAN+3" countries, (China, Japan, and South Korea).
          Chiang Mai was one of three Thai cities contending for Thailand's bid
          to host the World Expo 2020.[13] Ayutthaya was ultimately chosen by
          the Thai Parliament to register for the international competition.[14]
          In early December 2017, Chiang Mai was awarded the UNESCO title of
          Creative City. In 2015, Chiang Mai was on the tentative list for
          UNESCO World Heritage inscription. Chiang Mai was one of two tourist
          destinations in Thailand on TripAdvisor's 2014 list of "25 Best
          Destinations in the World", where it stands at number 24.[15]
          "...Chiang Mai represents the prime diamond on the crown of Thailand,
          the crown cannot be sparkle and beauteous without the diamond..."
